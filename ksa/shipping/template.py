    <p>Hello, </p>
    <p>As you have heard or read, President Trump is likely planning on putting a 10% tariff on all goods from China. 
We cannot absorb the entire tariff  and cannot pass it on to our customers or they will probably cancel  many items. We  are going  to need your help with a reduction in  pricing  in order to be able to sell your product. What we feel is fair at this time is splitting the tariff. This means  a 5% reduction in your prices to us and we will absorb the other 5%. If the tariff amount changes up or down, we will still go with the 50/50 split.
The 5% or what ever the % is will be deducted when paying your invoices.
Thank you for your cooperation.<p>
    <p>Any comments, please send to Howard (hadler@kurtadler.com).  </p>
    <p>If you agree, please reply to Penny to confirm your acceptance of the 50/50 split. </p>
    <p>
    <br>Howard<br/>
